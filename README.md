# fare-estimation


## TODO

- Proper system test with less data, which could test removal of invalid data

- more unit-tests, specially on tuple, but I'm happy with the main AddTuple() that is the main test

- split every 1km instead of just more than 1km on every tuple

- idle hours fare

- concurrency could be easily added on AddTuple()
